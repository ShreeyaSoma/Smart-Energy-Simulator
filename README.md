# ⚡ Smart Energy Consumption Simulator

A **Streamlit-powered interactive simulator** to model and analyze daily household energy consumption.  
Built to help users **understand appliance usage patterns, forecast consumption, and receive actionable suggestions** to reduce energy bills — all within a simple, interactive dashboard.

---

## 🌍 Why This Project?

Most households receive an electricity bill **after** usage, leaving no room for proactive control.  
This project changes that by allowing you to **simulate and forecast consumption day by day**, empowering users to:

- Identify **top energy-consuming appliances**
- Forecast **daily, weekly, and monthly consumption**
- Compare **cost savings from usage adjustments**
- Get **personalized suggestions** to stay under a daily limit

## 🚀 Key Functionalities

- **🔌 Appliance Control Panel**
  - Toggle appliances ON/OFF in real-time
  - Fridge is always ON (baseline load)
  
- **📊 Live Energy Metrics**
  - Daily consumption and cost
  - Alerts when daily limits are exceeded
  - Visual breakdown of appliance usage
  
- **📈 Trend Visualizations**
  - Daily and weekly consumption trend graphs
  - Appliance-wise usage comparison charts

- **💡 Intelligent Suggestions**
  - Find top appliances to cut down tomorrow
  - Explore savings by reducing AC usage
  - See fridge contribution to total usage

- **ℹ️ Transparent Calculation Metrics**
  - Rate: ₹6 per kWh
  - Assumed usage hours for appliances
  - Hybrid model approach with a pre-trained Random Forest

## ⚙️ Tech Behind the Scenes

- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io)  
- **Backend Logic**: Pre-trained Random Forest Model (`energy_model.pkl`)  
- **Visualization**: Plotly Express  
- **Dataset**: Synthetic household appliance energy consumption data  
- **Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces (Dockerized with Streamlit entrypoint)

## 🏗️ Deployment Notes

The project was successfully deployed to **Hugging Face Spaces** with a few streamlined changes:

1. **Pre-trained Model**  
   - Instead of retraining, the app loads a `energy_model.pkl` file directly for instant predictions.

2. **Simplified File Structure**  
   - Kept all necessary files (`app.py`, `synthetic_energy_data.csv`, `energy_model.pkl`) inside the `src` folder for easy deployment.  
   - Removed training scripts not required in production (`train_and_prepare_model.py`).

3. **Dockerfile Update**  
   - Entrypoint set to launch the Streamlit app from the `src` directory.  
   - Exposed port `8501` for Hugging Face hosting.

4. **Session Handling**  
   - Used Streamlit session state to simulate day progression, weekly tracking, and history-based insights.
